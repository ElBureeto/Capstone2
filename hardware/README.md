# Hardware

This document covers the development of the hardware portion of our project.

The circuit the team decide to use rectifies the incoming sinudoidal wave, amplifies it and finally filters it.

In this picture you can see how we implemented it using a bread board

After the circuit was assembled we powered it using an usb power supply.

With a filter

As you can see the signal will output a decent wave although it may need a better filter based on how much precision you neeed.
